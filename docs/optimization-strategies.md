## Adjacency Representation and Comparison

### Binary Encoding for Adjacencies

#### Bit Masks and Flags

Instead of storing adjacencies as strings or arrays of strings, we can represent them using bit masks:

```typescript
// Current string-based representation
adjacencies = [
  "A,B,C",  // Top
  "B,D",    // Right
  "A,C",    // Bottom
  "A,B,D"   // Left
];

// Binary representation
// A = 1, B = 2, C = 4, D = 8
adjacencies = [
  0b0111,  // Top: A,B,C = 1+2+4 = 7
  0b1010,  // Right: B,D = 2+8 = 10
  0b0101,  // Bottom: A,C = 1+4 = 5
  0b1011   // Left: A,B,D = 1+2+8 = 11
];
```

Benefits:
- Much faster comparison operations using bitwise AND/OR
- Reduced memory footprint
- Efficient compatibility checks using bitwise operations

Implementation considerations:
- Limited to 32 or 64 distinct tile types (depending on integer size)
- May need additional mapping for large tile sets (composite bit arrays)

### Virtual Adjacency Types for Directional Relationships

For directional adjacencies expressed as "A>B" (on one side) and "B>A" (on the opposite side), create virtual adjacency types to represent these pairs:

```typescript
// Original directional adjacency notation
tile1.adjacencies = [
  "A>B,C>D",  // Top
  "E>F",      // Right
  "G>H",      // Bottom
  "I>J"       // Left
];

tile2.adjacencies = [
  "H>G",      // Top (matching Bottom of tile1)
  "J>I",      // Right (matching Left of tile1)
  "F>E",      // Bottom (matching Right of tile1)
  "B>A,D>C"   // Left (matching Top of tile1)
];

// Map directional pairs to virtual adjacency types
const virtualAdjacencyMap = {
  // Format: "direction:adjacency" -> virtualType
  "top:A>B": "V1",
  "bottom:B>A": "V1", // Same virtual type for the opposite
  "top:C>D": "V2",
  "bottom:D>C": "V2",
  "right:E>F": "V3",
  "bottom:F>E": "V3",
  // And so on...
};

// Pre-process adjacencies to use virtual types
function preprocessAdjacencies(tile, direction, adjacencies) {
  return adjacencies.split(",").map(adj => {
    const key = `${direction}:${adj}`;
    return virtualAdjacencyMap[key] || adj;
  });
}
```

Benefits:
- Simplifies compatibility checks between tiles
- Reduces the number of distinct adjacency types to track
- Makes constraint propagation more efficient
- Can be combined with binary encoding for further optimization

Implementation:
- Create a preprocessing step that converts directional adjacencies to virtual types
- When comparing tile compatibility, compare using these virtual types
- Can be combined with the binary encoding approach by assigning bit positions to virtual types

### Adjacency Lookups

#### Reverse Adjacency Maps

Create pre-computed adjacency compatibility maps for quick lookups:

```typescript
// Pre-compute a lookup table
const compatibilityLookup = {
  // For each tile type and direction, store compatible tiles
  "A": {
    "top": new Set(["B", "C"]),
    "right": new Set(["D"]),
    "bottom": new Set(["A", "B"]),
    "left": new Set(["C", "D"])
  },
  // ...
};
```

Benefits:
- O(1) lookup time for compatible tiles
- Eliminate repeated compatibility calculations
- Faster propagation of constraints

Implementation considerations:
- Increased memory usage for the lookup tables
- Need to update tables when rules change

### Directional Adjacency Optimization

For grid-based patterns, store directional compatibility separately:

```typescript
// For each tile, cache valid neighbors in each direction
const directionalCompatibility = new Map();
directionalCompatibility.set("A", {
  top: new Set([/*tiles that can be placed above A*/]),
  right: new Set([/*tiles that can be placed to the right of A*/]),
  bottom: new Set([/*tiles that can be placed below A*/]),
  left: new Set([/*tiles that can be placed to the left of A*/])
});
```

Benefits:
- Immediate access to compatible tiles for a given direction
- Eliminates the need to filter general adjacency lists by direction

## State Management and Propagation

### Efficient Cell Selection

#### Minimum Entropy Heuristic Optimization

Maintain a priority queue of cells based on entropy (number of possible states):

```typescript
class MinimumEntropyQueue {
  private cells: MinHeap<Cell>;
  
  // Add/update cell in the queue based on entropy
  update(cell: Cell): void {
    // Update the cell's position in the min-heap based on its entropy
  }
  
  // Get the cell with minimum entropy
  getNext(): Cell {
    return this.cells.extractMin();
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Efficient selection of the next cell to collapse
- Potentially reduces the number of backtracking steps

### Propagation Optimization

#### Incremental Constraint Propagation

Only propagate constraints to affected neighbors:

```typescript
function propagateConstraints(changedCell: Cell): void {
  const queue = [changedCell];
  const visited = new Set();
  
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const cell = queue.shift();
    if (visited.has(cell.id)) continue;
    visited.add(cell.id);
    
    for (const neighbor of getNeighbors(cell)) {
      const changed = updatePossibleStates(neighbor, cell);
      if (changed) {
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Avoids unnecessary updates to unaffected cells
- Can significantly reduce computation in large grids

#### Observer Pattern for Change Propagation

Implement an observer pattern to track and propagate changes:

```typescript
class Cell {
  private observers: Set<Cell> = new Set();
  
  subscribe(observer: Cell): void {
    this.observers.add(observer);
  }
  
  notifyObservers(): void {
    for (const observer of this.observers) {
      observer.update(this);
    }
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- More targeted propagation of changes
- Reduces unnecessary constraint checks

## Backtracking and Snapshot Optimization

### Delta-Based Snapshots

Instead of storing complete grid states, store only the changes:

```typescript
interface StateDelta {
  timestamp: number;
  changes: Array<{
    cellId: string;
    removed: Set<string>; // Tile options removed
    wasCollapsed: boolean;
    previousValue?: string;
  }>;
}

// To create a snapshot
function createDelta(changedCells: Cell[]): StateDelta {
  return {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    changes: changedCells.map(cell => ({
      cellId: cell.id,
      removed: new Set(cell.removedOptions),
      wasCollapsed: cell.wasCollapsed,
      previousValue: cell.wasCollapsed ? cell.previousValue : undefined
    }))
  };
}

// To apply a delta (rollback)
function applyDelta(delta: StateDelta): void {
  for (const change of delta.changes) {
    const cell = getCellById(change.cellId);
    // Restore removed options
    for (const option of change.removed) {
      cell.addOption(option);
    }
    // Restore collapsed state if needed
    if (change.wasCollapsed) {
      cell.setValue(change.previousValue);
    } else {
      cell.uncollapse();
    }
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Significantly reduced memory usage for backtracking
- More efficient for small, incremental changes
- Can be stacked to represent multiple steps

### Intelligent Backtracking

#### Conflict-Directed Backjumping

Instead of simple chronological backtracking, jump back to the source of conflicts:

```typescript
function backtrackToConflict(conflict: Conflict): void {
  // Analyze the conflict to determine its root cause
  const rootCause = analyzeConflictSource(conflict);
  
  // Jump back to the decision that caused the conflict
  revertToDecision(rootCause.decisionId);
  
  // Mark the choice that led to the conflict as forbidden
  forbidChoice(rootCause.decisionId, rootCause.choice);
}
```

Benefits:
- Avoids wasting time on unrelated backtracking steps
- Can dramatically improve performance for complex patterns

#### Pattern-Based Backtracking

Store common conflict patterns and use them to guide backtracking:

```typescript
const knownConflictPatterns = new Map<string, BacktrackStrategy>();

function backtrack(conflict: Conflict): void {
  const patternKey = generateConflictPatternKey(conflict);
  
  if (knownConflictPatterns.has(patternKey)) {
    // Apply specialized backtracking strategy for this pattern
    const strategy = knownConflictPatterns.get(patternKey);
    strategy.execute(conflict);
  } else {
    // Fall back to standard backtracking
    standardBacktrack(conflict);
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Learns from previous failures
- More intelligent recovery from common conflicts

## Memory Usage Optimization

### Shared Pattern References

Use a flyweight pattern for commonly used data:

```typescript
// Singleton pattern repository
class PatternRepository {
  private static instance: PatternRepository;
  private patterns: Map<string, TilePattern> = new Map();
  
  static getInstance(): PatternRepository {
    if (!PatternRepository.instance) {
      PatternRepository.instance = new PatternRepository();
    }
    return PatternRepository.instance;
  }
  
  getPattern(key: string): TilePattern {
    if (!this.patterns.has(key)) {
      this.patterns.set(key, createPattern(key));
    }
    return this.patterns.get(key);
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Reduces memory usage for repeated patterns
- Improves cache locality

### Sparse Representation for Large Grids

For large grids with many similar cells, use sparse representation:

```typescript
class SparseGrid {
  private defaultCell: Cell;
  private specialCells: Map<string, Cell> = new Map();
  
  getCell(x: number, y: number): Cell {
    const key = `${x},${y}`;
    return this.specialCells.has(key) 
      ? this.specialCells.get(key)
      : this.defaultCell;
  }
  
  setCell(x: number, y: number, cell: Cell): void {
    const key = `${x},${y}`;
    if (cell.equals(this.defaultCell)) {
      // If cell is same as default, don't store it
      this.specialCells.delete(key);
    } else {
      this.specialCells.set(key, cell);
    }
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Dramatic memory savings for large grids with repetitive patterns
- Potential performance improvement through reduced memory usage

## Algorithmic Improvements

### Incremental Collapse Strategy

Collapse cells in batches, propagating constraints after each batch:

```typescript
function incrementalCollapse(batchSize: number = 10): void {
  let remainingCells = getAllUncollapsedCells();
  
  while (remainingCells.length > 0) {
    // Take a batch of cells with lowest entropy
    const batch = pickLowestEntropyBatch(remainingCells, batchSize);
    
    // Collapse each cell in the batch
    for (const cell of batch) {
      collapseCell(cell);
    }
    
    // Propagate constraints once after the batch
    propagateConstraints();
    
    // Update remaining cells
    remainingCells = getAllUncollapsedCells();
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Reduces the number of constraint propagation passes
- Can be more efficient for large grids

### Parallel Processing

Utilize parallel processing for independent operations:

```typescript
async function parallelConstraintPropagation(cells: Cell[]): Promise<void> {
  // Group cells into independent sets that can be processed in parallel
  const independentSets = groupIntoIndependentSets(cells);
  
  // Process each set in parallel
  await Promise.all(independentSets.map(async (set) => {
    for (const cell of set) {
      await propagateConstraintsForCell(cell);
    }
  }));
}
```

Benefits:
- Leverages multi-core processors
- Potential for significant speedup on large grids

### Early Termination Strategies

Detect and handle unsolvable states early:

```typescript
function isLikelyUnsolvable(grid: Grid): boolean {
  // Check for common patterns that indicate unsolvable states
  
  // 1. Cell with no valid options
  if (hasEmptyCells(grid)) return true;
  
  // 2. Isolated region with impossible constraints
  if (hasImpossibleIslands(grid)) return true;
  
  // 3. Check for constraint cycles that cannot be satisfied
  if (hasConstraintCycles(grid)) return true;
  
  return false;
}
```

Benefits:
- Avoids wasting time on unsolvable states
- Faster backtracking to viable states

## Advanced Techniques

### Machine Learning for Pattern Recognition

Train a model to recognize patterns that lead to successful or failed states:

```typescript
class MLPredictor {
  private model: any; // ML model
  
  predictSuccess(gridState: any): number {
    // Return probability of successful completion from this state
    return this.model.predict(encodeGridState(gridState));
  }
  
  suggestNextCell(gridState: any): Cell {
    // Recommend the next cell to collapse based on learned patterns
    return this.model.suggestNextAction(encodeGridState(gridState));
  }
}
```

Benefits:
- Can learn from previous runs to improve future performance
- Potential to avoid common pitfalls

### Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Techniques

Apply advanced CSP techniques from academic literature:

1. **Arc Consistency Algorithms (AC-3, AC-4)**
   - More efficient constraint propagation
   - Detect inconsistencies earlier

2. **Forward Checking**
   - Look ahead to future constraints
   - Prune invalid choices earlier

3. **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) with Degree Heuristic**
   - Enhanced cell selection beyond basic entropy

Implementation example:

```typescript
function applyAC3(grid: Grid): boolean {
  const queue = getAllConstraints(grid);
  
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [xi, xj] = queue.shift();
    
    if (removeInconsistentValues(xi, xj)) {
      // If we removed values, add all constraints involving xi
      for (const xk of getNeighbors(xi)) {
        if (xk !== xj) {
          queue.push([xk, xi]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Check if any domain became empty
  return !hasEmptyDomain(grid);
}
```

### Hierarchical WFC

Implement a multi-resolution approach for very large outputs:

```typescript
function hierarchicalWFC(finalSize: Size): Grid {
  // Start with a small grid
  let grid = createInitialGrid(smallSize);
  collapse(grid);
  
  // Progressively increase resolution
  while (grid.size < finalSize) {
    grid = upscale(grid);
    refine(grid);
    collapse(grid);
  }
  
  return grid;
}
```

Benefits:
- Can handle extremely large outputs more efficiently
- Often produces more coherent large-scale structures

## Optimization Scenarios and Limitations

#### Notes on Scenario-Specific Optimizations:

1. **For Large Grid Size:**
   - Sparse grid representation is crucial for memory efficiency
   - Incremental constraint propagation and parallel processing can significantly improve performance
   - Hierarchical WFC approach can be transformative for extremely large grids
   - Delta-based snapshots help manage memory during backtracking

2. **For Many Tile Types:**
   - Binary encoding may be limited by integer size, requiring composite bit arrays 
   - Virtual adjacency types can drastically reduce complexity
   - Shared pattern references become essential for memory management
   - Intelligent backtracking helps navigate the larger possibility space

3. **For Complex Adjacency Rules:**
   - Binary encoding and virtual adjacency types offer significant performance improvements
   - Reverse adjacency maps provide fast constraint checking
   - Delta-based snapshots and intelligent backtracking help recover from contradictions
   - Early termination strategies prevent wasted computation on unsolvable configurations

4. **For Many Tiles but Few Adjacency Types:**
   - Binary encoding is particularly effective due to the compact representation of adjacency types
   - Shared pattern references can be leveraged for the repeating patterns
   - Delta-based snapshots are highly effective since changes may be localized

### Current Implementation Limitations and Adaptations

Our current WFC implementation has several limitations that could be addressed in future versions:

#### 1. No Dynamic Tiles

**Current Limitation:**
- Tiles and their adjacency rules are defined statically before the algorithm runs
- Cannot add or modify tiles or rules during execution
- Cannot adapt to emerging patterns or user interactions

**Potential Adaptations:**
- Implement a rule modification API that properly updates all derived data structures (lookup tables, etc.)
- Design a caching system that can invalidate and rebuild only the affected parts of the data structures
- Create an event system to propagate rule changes throughout the grid
- Add support for conditional rules that can be activated/deactivated based on context

#### 2. Fixed Grid Structure

**Current Limitation:**
- The algorithm assumes a regular grid with fixed neighbors
- Cannot easily handle irregular structures or dynamic topology

**Potential Adaptations:**
- Abstract the neighbor relationship model to support arbitrary topologies
- Implement a generic graph-based structure instead of a grid
- Support runtime modification of the connectivity graph
- Allow for multi-scale or hierarchical structures

#### 3. Limited Context Awareness

**Current Limitation:**
- Cells are constrained only by immediate neighbors
- Cannot easily enforce larger-scale patterns or global constraints

**Potential Adaptations:**
- Add support for long-range constraints
- Implement hierarchical constraints across multiple scales
- Support pattern matching over regions larger than individual cells
- Allow for global statistical constraints (e.g., "25% of tiles must be of type X")

#### 4. Limited Backtracking Strategy

**Current Limitation:**
- Basic chronological backtracking can be inefficient for complex patterns
- No learning from previous failures to guide future attempts

**Potential Adaptations:**
- Implement conflict-directed backjumping
- Add pattern recognition for common failure cases
- Store and learn from failed attempts to guide future efforts
- Introduce heuristic functions trained on successful patterns

#### 5. No Memory Constraints

**Current Limitation:**
- Algorithm can use unlimited memory as the grid size grows
- No built-in mechanisms for handling memory pressure

**Potential Adaptations:**
- Implement memory budgets and prioritized caching
- Add streaming capability for very large grids
- Develop incremental processing modes that work on subsets of the grid
- Support serialization/deserialization of partial states for external storage

#### 6. Deterministic Output

**Current Limitation:**
- While the algorithm is probabilistic, it's not designed to generate controlled variety
- Cannot easily guide the output toward specific desired patterns

**Potential Adaptations:**
- Add bias parameters to influence tile selection
- Support template or example-based constraints
- Implement distance functions from desired patterns
- Allow interactive guidance or "painting" of constraints

### Implementing Adaptations

Many of these limitations can be addressed while maintaining the core WFC algorithm. Here are approaches for extending the implementation:

1. **For Dynamic Tiles:**
   ```typescript
   class DynamicTileManager {
     private tileDefinitions: Map<string, TileDef> = new Map();
     private adjacencyCache: Map<string, Set<string>> = new Map();
     
     addTile(tileDef: TileDef): void {
       this.tileDefinitions.set(tileDef.name, tileDef);
       this.invalidateAffectedCaches(tileDef);
     }
     
     updateTileAdjacencies(tileName: string, adjacencies: string[][]): void {
       const tile = this.tileDefinitions.get(tileName);
       if (tile) {
         tile.adjacencies = adjacencies;
         this.invalidateAffectedCaches(tile);
       }
     }
     
     private invalidateAffectedCaches(tileDef: TileDef): void {
       // Clear caches that involve this tile
       // Rebuild necessary lookup tables
     }
   }
   ```

2. **For Arbitrary Topologies:**
   ```typescript
   interface Topology {
     getNeighbors(cellId: string): string[];
     getDirection(fromCellId: string, toCellId: string): string;
     getAllCells(): string[];
   }
   
   class GraphTopology implements Topology {
     private graph: Map<string, Set<string>> = new Map();
     private directions: Map<string, Map<string, string>> = new Map();
     
     addConnection(fromCellId: string, toCellId: string, direction: string): void {
       // Add edge to graph
       // Store direction information
     }
     
     getNeighbors(cellId: string): string[] {
       return Array.from(this.graph.get(cellId) || []);
     }
     
     getDirection(fromCellId: string, toCellId: string): string {
       return this.directions.get(fromCellId)?.get(toCellId) || '';
     }
   }
   ```

3. **For Long-Range Constraints:**
   ```typescript
   interface Constraint {
     evaluate(grid: Grid): boolean;
     affectedCells(grid: Grid): string[];
   }
   
   class RegionConstraint implements Constraint {
     constructor(
       private region: string[],
       private pattern: (tiles: Map<string, string>) => boolean
     ) {}
     
     evaluate(grid: Grid): boolean {
       const tiles = new Map();
       for (const cellId of this.region) {
         tiles.set(cellId, grid.getCell(cellId).getValue());
       }
       return this.pattern(tiles);
     }
     
     affectedCells(grid: Grid): string[] {
       return this.region;
     }
   }
   ```

By carefully designing these extensions, we can maintain the core efficiency of the WFC algorithm while addressing its limitations and expanding its capabilities for more complex applications.
